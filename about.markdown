Hi,I am a programmer,mainly focused on backend development.

I am interested in many technology things,and My goal is to be a 
`full stack` developer.Below are the technologies I have used and loved:
	C/C++/Lua/Erlang/Go/Node.js

And recently,I'm focusing on Node.js.

This site is generated using `jekyll`,and the layout is jekyll's default
template.
