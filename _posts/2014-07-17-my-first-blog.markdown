Hello,this is my `first` blog,published at this github provided site,built using jekyll,thank Github.

I will write blogs in `English` afterwards. Because I think writing in English is cool,and it's a big advantage for practicing 
my English ability of expression.

This blog is mainly for technology things. I'm interested in technology,include Erlang/C/Unix/Node.js/Ruby/Vim/Git,and almost
`all` the other things related to `Unix` culture.Now I'm using Node.js and mongo and Redis at work.

You can find me at [Github][github],[Twitter][twitter] or [Email][email].
