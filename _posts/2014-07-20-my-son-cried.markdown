Today,I took my son come to Beijing with me.It's a hot day,and it's a hard journey.
I drove car in the highway, due to the hot weather,it's very easily to feel sleepy.
My wife drove for a while.

When we got home,I feel very tired,and My wife and mom went to vegetable market for
dinner,I sleep with son at home.I woke up ,and I stared at my son's face.He frowned 
,and I felt he's going to cry,and he DID.

He cried very loud.I was feeling anxious.I talked to him,but he didn't hear me at all.
I had to call his mom.When his mom got home and embraced him,he stopped cry.

I've leared two things from this,first,I feel really sad when I saw my son crying,and
second,mom is one's most close person in the world(even compare to his/her father).
