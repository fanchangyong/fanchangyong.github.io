I was always annoying with too many windows management on OS X.It was very
difficult to switch from one application to another,and using the trackpad 
to operate the GUIs is very annoying and tired.I explored many window manager
applications on OS X platform,most of them are imperfect.At last,I found 
[slate][slate],it's open source project on GitHub,and it's powerful and 
configurable.

It has many features,now I only used one of them.press Ctrl-space,It could 
display a character on every applications,and press the corresponding key,
it would focus the application,it's very efficient and interesting.More
importantly,it enables me to operate GUI applications with keyboard,it's
very very good for me,I love keyboard,and I hate mouse or trackpad.I also 
changed my web browser from Safari to Firefox,because its abundant plugin
ecosystem.I discoverd a very very powerful plugin called [Vimperator][Vimperator],
It allows
me browse the web use Vim operations,it's very very good!
